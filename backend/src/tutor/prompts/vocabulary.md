## Your Analysis

Provide the following vocabulary analysis based on the student's comprehension level:

1. **Key Vocabulary**: Extract 5-10 important words from the text (adjust based on text length)

   For each word:
   - The word itself
   - Part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
   - Definition in English
   - Korean translation
   - Example sentence showing usage
   - Related words (synonyms, antonyms, word family)

2. **Idioms and Phrases**: Identify any idioms, phrasal verbs, or fixed expressions

3. **Word Formation**: Break down complex words (prefixes, roots, suffixes) for levels 3-5

4. **Context Clues**: Explain how to understand word meanings from context

5. **Learning Tips**: Provide strategies for remembering these words
