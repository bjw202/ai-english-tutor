## Your Analysis

Provide the following grammatical analysis based on the student's comprehension level:

1. **Grammar Check**: Identify any grammatical errors in the text (if any)

2. **Structure Analysis**: Break down the sentence structure(s) including:
   - Subject and predicate
   - Clauses (main, subordinate, relative)
   - Phrases (noun, verb, prepositional)

3. **Tense Usage**: Identify verb tenses used and explain why they're appropriate

4. **Key Grammar Points**: Highlight important grammar concepts demonstrated in the text

5. **Improvement Suggestions**: Suggest ways to improve clarity or correctness (if applicable)

## Guidelines

- Adjust your terminology based on the student's level
- For levels 1-2: Use simple terms with Korean explanations, focus on basic S-V-O structure
- For level 3: Use standard grammar terminology (subject, verb, object, clause)
- For levels 4-5: Include advanced concepts (subjunctive mood, passive voice nuances, parallel structure)
- If the text is already grammatically correct, acknowledge this and explain what makes it good
- Always be constructive and educational
- Format your response clearly with examples
